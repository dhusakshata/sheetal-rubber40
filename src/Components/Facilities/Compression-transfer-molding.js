        Our production line utilizes Compression Transfer Molding, a highly efficient process for shaping rubber compounds into finished products. This method involves placing pre-measured rubber material into a heated mold, where it is subjected to pressure to achieve the desired shape and density. Compression transfer molding ensures uniform material distribution and optimal curing, resulting in high-quality rubber components with consistent properties. This process is ideal for producing complex shapes and larger quantities, enhancing production efficiency while maintaining rigorous quality standards in our finished products.
